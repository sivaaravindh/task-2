		    The national animal
		     </h2>
		      <p>
				Tiger is the national animal of India. Therefore, tigers are considered very sacred in India. Several folkloric tales contain stories about tigers. In Hindu mythology, tigers often act as vahana or mount for some Indian goddesses like Durga.
					Tigers are full of glorious might and unmatchable bravery. However, tigers are quite recluse creatures in their habitat, unlike lions. Although full of courage and power, tigers prefer to stay within their territories. The home of the tiger is called a “lair”.
			     		Therefore, most tigers live inside their lair and territory. However, any national animal tiger essay will remain incomplete without discussing the 
							family of tigers.</p>
				<h3>
					habit
					</h3>
						<p>
							The female tiger is called a “tigress” and the offspring is called a “cub”. Unlike lions, male tigers do not stay in their lairs to protect them from attack. Both tigers and tigresses practice hunting during the day and sleep at night. 
								A tiger’s roar is extremely loud and powerful. It communicates with the other tigers through its roars. Tigers are very clever animals. Their hunting tactics include hiding behind thick bushes and suddenly attacking their prey. 
									Tigers generally eat small animals like deer, bullocks, antelope, etc. Tigers are often called man-eaters, however, they only prey on humans when they’re harmed by humans or cannot find any other animal to prey on. Although this 
										tiger essay states details about the power of a tiger, this tiger information in an English essay would be invalid without mentioning the kindness and generosity tigers display. Tigers are considered very kind creatures. 
											They tend to share their prey with tigers outside their territories. Oftentimes, a male tiger raises cubs on his own without the tigress’s help. Tigers raise orphaned cubs belonging to other 
										      tigers as well habit</p>
