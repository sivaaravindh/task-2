		    The national animal
		     </h2>
		      <p>
				Tiger is the national animal of India. Therefore, tigers are considered very sacred in India. Several folkloric tales contain stories about tigers. In Hindu mythology, tigers often act as vahana or mount for some Indian goddesses like Durga.
					Tigers are full of glorious might and unmatchable bravery. However, tigers are quite recluse creatures in their habitat, unlike lions. Although full of courage and power, tigers prefer to stay within their territories. The home of the tiger is called a “lair”.
			     		Therefore, most tigers live inside their lair and territory. However, any national animal tiger essay will remain incomplete without discussing the 
							family of tigers.</p>
				<h2>
					habit
					</h2>
						<p>
							The female tiger is called a “tigress” and the offspring is called a “cub”. Unlike lions, male tigers do not stay in their lairs to protect them from attack. Both tigers and tigresses practice hunting during the day and sleep at night. 
							  A tiger’s roar is extremely loud and powerful. It communicates with the other tigers through its roars. Tigers are very clever animals. Their hunting tactics include hiding behind thick bushes and suddenly attacking their prey. 
								Tigers generally eat small animals like deer, bullocks, antelope, etc. Tigers are often called man-eaters, however, they only prey on humans when they’re harmed by humans or cannot find any other animal to prey on. Although this 
								   tiger essay states details about the power of a tiger, this tiger information in an English essay would be invalid without mentioning the kindness and generosity tigers display. Tigers are considered very kind creatures. 
									   They tend to share their prey with tigers outside their territories. Oftentimes, a male tiger raises cubs on his own without the tigress’s help. Tigers raise orphaned cubs belonging to other 
										   tigers as well habit Tiger is the national animal of India. It is a wild animal found in places of<B> West Bengal, Assam, central India, etc</B>. In my favourite animal tiger essay, some characteristics of the tiger are discussed.
											  A short paragraph on tiger: The tiger is considered a sacred animal in India. It is present in numerous Indian folklores and is associated with Indian goddesses such as the goddess Durga. The tiger is a symbol of power, bravery and might. 
												The tiger is a carnivore and it preys on animals such as deer, bullocks, antelopes, etc. the female tiger is called the “tigress” and the offspring is the “cub”. Tigers live in “lairs”. They communicate with each other through roars and are 
												   recluse animals. Tigers are very kind to one another. However, humans kill tigers for their skin and nails and capture them in zoos away from the wildlife which makes them unhappy.Therefore, from this short essay on tigers, it can be concluded that 
													  tigers are very important in maintaining the balance of the environment. They are a symbol of power and rage. However, they are endangered and should be protected from human
														cruelties.</p>

				    The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, 
				     tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from <b>Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, </b>and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is 
					 fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian island,
					 Sumatra.</p>
